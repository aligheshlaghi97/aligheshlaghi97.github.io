I built a FastAPI backend + React frontend (both deployed) that recommends the right database for your project, inspired by Seven Databases in Seven Weeks book.

🔎 How it works:
- Utilizes Google Gemini embeddings and Qdrant vector search 
- Answer 10 questions to receive the top 3 recommended databases 
- Gemini-1.5-flash for polished explanations 

🛠️ Lightweight: Runs on 1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM
